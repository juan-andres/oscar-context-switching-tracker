A context switching tracker to help you better understand how you work and how often you get interrupted. Also handy to record what you do everyday!

# How to use it
From your console (in the repo directory)
Either open the index.html in your browser

```open index.html```

OR

run your own http server (too fancy for this for now :\ )

```python -m SimpleHTTPServer```
